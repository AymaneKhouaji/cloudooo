- XMLRPC + WSGI will be one bridge for easy access OpenOffice.org. This will implement one XMLRPC server into WSGI (Paster).

- PyUno is used to connect to OpenOffice.org stated with open socket. The features will be handled all by pyuno.

- Xvfb is used to run Openoffice.org. This is controlled by Daemon(cloudooo).

- Only a process will have access to OpenOffice.org by time.

- All clients receive the same object(proxy) when connects with XMLRPC Server.

Xvfb and OpenOffice

 - configure and start Xvfb;
    - Use a single Xvfb;
    - the xvfb will be started with the XMLRPC Server;
	- When start the Daemon(cloudooo), it configures Xvfb, next opens the openoffice(with pyuno) and start XMLRPC Server; 
 - control Xvfb;
 - start openoffice;
   - Pyuno start the openoffice processes and the communication is through sockets;
   - Openoffice processes run in brackground and in virtual display;
 - control openoffice;
   - The socket can't lose the connection, if this occurs should kill the process and submit again the file;

XMLRPC Server - XMLRPC + WSGI
-----------------------------

  - Send document to openoffice and return the document converted with metadata;
      - XMLRPC receives a file and connects to a openoffice by pyuno;
      - The pyuno opens a new openoffice, write, add metadata and returns the document edited or converted to xmlrpc and it return the document to the user;
      - When finalize the use of openoffice, should make sure that it was finalized;
  - Export to another format;
  - Invite document and return metadata only;
  - Edit metadata of the document;

       - finalize the process, start openoffice and submit the document again(without restart the cloudooo);
     - Openoffice is crashed;
       - finalize the process, verify if all the process was killed, start openoffice and submit the document again(without restart the cloudooo)
     - OpenOffice received the document and stalled;
